[00:07.69] My grandpa fought in World War II
[00:09.33] He was such a noble dude
[00:11.15] I can't even finish school
[00:13.34] Missed my mom, and left too soon
[00:29.34] 
[00:15.48] His dad was a fireman
[00:17.53] Who fought fires so violent
[00:19.62] I think I bored my therapist
[00:21.64] While playing him my violin
[00:35.14] 
[00:23.80] (Oh, my God) that's so insane
[00:25.88] (Oh, my God) that's such a shame
[00:27.97] Next to them, my shit don't feel so grand
[00:31.82] But I can't help myself from feeling bad
[00:36.03] I kinda feel like two things can be sad (one, two, three, four)
[01:07.53] 
[00:40.13] The world's smallest violin
[00:42.31] Really needs an audience
[00:44.19] So if I do not find somebody soon (that's right, that's right)
[00:48.51] I'll blow up into smithereens
[00:50.43] And spew my tiny symphony
[00:52.57] Just let me play my violin for you, you, you, you
[01:17.07] 
[01:13.25] My grandpa fought in World War II
[01:15.22] And he was such a noble dude
[01:17.22] Man, I feel like such a fool
[01:19.28] I got so much left to prove
[01:32.78] 
[01:21.60] All my friends have vaping friends
[01:23.70] They're so good at making friеnds
[01:25.73] I'm so scared of caving in
[01:27.76] Is that entertaining yеt?
[01:40.26] 
[01:29.76] (Oh, my God) that's so insane
[01:31.99] (Oh, my God) that's such a shame
[01:34.02] Next to them, my shit don't feel so grand
[01:38.18] But I can't help myself from feeling bad
[01:42.28] I kinda feel like two things can be sad (one, two, three, four)
[02:13.78] 
[01:46.16] The world's smallest violin
[01:48.53] Really needs an audience
[01:50.33] So if I do not find somebody soon (that's right, that's right)
[01:54.64] I'll blow up into smithereens
[01:56.77] And spew my tiny symphony
[01:58.75] Just let me play my violin for you, you, you, you
[02:23.25] 
[02:19.99] Somewhere in the universe
[02:21.68] Somewhere someone's got it worse
[02:23.43] Wish that made it easier
[02:25.67] Wish I didn't feel the hurt
[02:39.17] 
[02:27.70] The world's smallest violin
[02:29.98] Really needs an audience
[02:31.88] So if I do not find somebody soon
[02:48.38] 
[02:36.11] I'll blow up into smithereens
[02:38.97] And spew my tiny symphony
[02:41.40] All up and down a city street
[02:43.55] While tryna put my mind at ease
[02:45.14] Like finishing this melody
[02:46.95] This feels like a necessity
[02:48.67] So this could be the death of me
[02:50.17] Or maybe just a better me
[03:02.67] 
[02:51.84] Now, come in with the timpanis
[02:53.07] And take a shot of Hennessy
[02:54.77] I know I'm not there mentally
[02:56.18] But you could be the remedy
[02:57.83] So let me play my violin for you
