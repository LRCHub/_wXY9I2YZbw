Betty,
I really hope you're on my side
I really hope you get it
Betty,
I really hope you're on my side
I really hope you get it
I tried to get my shit together
Now you want a break cause
I'm not ready for forever
I wonder if you hate me
I bet I hate me more
Oh trust me,
I'd give anything to tell
you that I'm sure
I don't wanna lose you,
I'm just thinking out loud
So could you call me back,
hello,
hello
I'm trying to work this out
I know your friends say when
you know, you know
I just don't know right now
So could you call me back,
hello,
hello
I'm trying to work this out
I know your friends say when
you know, you know
I just don't know right now
Betty,
I really hope you're on my side
I really hope you get it
Next time you see your folks
at dinner
Just ask your mom to please
stop pointin' at your finger
I know she calls me son now
Your dad, he calls me kid
I'm sorry I'm not man enough
to face them both like this
Don't read my last two messages,
I barely slept an hour
So could you call me back,
hello,
hello
I'm trying to work this out
I know your friends say when
you know, you know
I just don't know right now
Oh could you give me just
a year or so
I'll straighten out my head
I know your friends say when
you know, you know
So maybe, maybe I'll know then
Betty,
I really hope you're on my side
I really hope you get it
Betty,
I really hope you're on my side
I really hope you get it
I don't know
I don't know
Betty,
I really hope you're on my side
I really hope you get it
Betty,
I really hope you're on my side
I really hope you get it
Betty,
I really hope you get it right
I just don't know right now
Betty,
I really hope you get it right
I just don't know right now
Betty,
I really hope you get it right
